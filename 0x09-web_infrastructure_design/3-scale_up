Scale Up – Advanced Web Infrastructure
Whiteboard Design
The infrastructure has been scaled to improve performance, redundancy, and fault tolerance. Components are separated into their own dedicated servers and the load balancers are configured in a clustered setup.

Infrastructure Overview
Components:

4 Servers Total

Server 1: Load Balancer #1 (HAProxy)

Server 2: Load Balancer #2 (HAProxy, cluster with LB#1)

Server 3: Web Server (Nginx)

Server 4: Application Server

Database Server(s): MySQL Primary and Replica (optional for read scaling)

Additional Elements Added in This Setup:

Second Load Balancer: Provides high availability for load balancing to avoid SPOF.

Split Components:

Web server runs on its own server (handles static content, forwards dynamic requests to application server).

Application server runs separately (executes backend application logic).

Database runs on its own server for better performance and isolation.

Flow Explanation
User Request → DNS resolves www.foobar.com to the public IP of one of the clustered load balancers.

HAProxy Cluster: If Load Balancer #1 is down, Load Balancer #2 takes over automatically.

Load Balancer uses a distribution algorithm (e.g., Round Robin) to forward requests to the Web Server.

Web Server (Nginx) serves static content directly or forwards application requests to the Application Server.

Application Server processes the request, interacts with the Database Server (MySQL), and sends data back through the web server to the client.

Reasons for Each Additional Element
Second Load Balancer: Ensures load balancing service is always available (removes single point of failure).

Dedicated Web Server: Reduces resource competition between serving static content and processing backend logic.

Dedicated Application Server: Improves performance and security by isolating backend execution from frontend serving.

Dedicated Database Server: Optimizes database performance and enables independent scaling of database resources.

Benefits
High Availability: Load balancer cluster ensures minimal downtime.

Improved Performance: Separation of roles reduces resource contention.

Scalability: Each tier (web, application, database) can be scaled independently.

Fault Tolerance: Failure in one tier does not directly bring down the others.

Issues
Complexity: More servers require more configuration and management.

Cost: Higher infrastructure and maintenance costs.

Database Write Bottleneck: If only one primary database exists for writes, it can become a bottleneck.
